# Data analyzing scripts 
Figures and exports with the outputs of analysed dataset that were produced by the scripts below are stored in the folder ```reports```.

1. Diachronic study (Quantitative chronological analysis of inscriptions, under development
[script_2_Temporal in Python](https://github.com/sdam-au/ancient_social_dynamics/blob/master/scripts/Python/2_py_TEMPORAL-ANALYSIS_research.ipynb))

1. Geospatial study (Quantitative spatial analysis of inscriptions, under development
[script_2_Spatial in Python](https://github.com/sdam-au/ancient_social_dynamics/blob/master/scripts/Python/2_py_SPATIAL-ANALYSIS_research.ipynb))

1. Urban network (Quantitative analysis of urban network in the Roman Empire, under development

# Script accessing workflow (internal SDAM project):

## Offline scenario

1. Download scripts from Github and run locally in Jupyter Notebook, but check the dependencies and libraries. 
2. The documentation needs further tests and elaboration.

## Online scenario

1. Go to Google Colab & sign in with your Google email account. 
2. Create a new notebook, select Github tab.
3. Paste in the URL of the notebook on Github (choose from dropdown menu, if you are using the same email account for Github and for Google).
4. Ingest and save to your own Goodle drive into Google Colab folder (it may be done automatically).
5. Google Colab includes all basic libraries but requires an install of unusual libraries once per session.
6. Committing any changes back to Github has to be further tested.
